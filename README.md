# LightIRC

Simple IRC client written in Lazarus.

## High Blood Alcohol Concentration Notice

All the code is written with a high blood alcohol concentration, be careful, this could kill your kitten.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to be a simple, lightweight, cross platform IRC client that can be used mostly for chat.

Also, it should be simple enough for the normal user. I know that "normal" users don't use IRC, so let's change that :)

## How to contribute

Take a look at the current issues, fork this shit and get cracking :)

If you want feature X, please see if it fits the project goals, otherwise it could be rejected. I will reject anything that adds complexity for the normal user, so ask first if not sure.

## Coding guidelines

Just read some of the code, guess you will get it ;D

## Indy 10

This project uses Indy 10 for the IRC Protocol.

A stripped down and patched copy of Indy10 is included in the Indy10 folder.
